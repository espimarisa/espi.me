# [espi.me][espi.me]

My personal website and blog, powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].

# Running

If you're going to fork my site and host it yourself, [GitHub pages][github-pages] works perfectly fine.

- Be sure you have [Ruby][ruby] installed and configured
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundler`
- `bundler exec jekyll serve`
- Navigate to http://localhost:4000
- ???
- Profit
