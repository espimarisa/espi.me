# [espi.me][espi.me]

my personal website and blog, powered by [jekyll][jekyll].

## setup

if you're going to fork my site and host it yourself, you can use [github pages][github-pages].

local development:

- be sure you have [ruby][ruby] installed and configured
  - `gem install bundler`
  - `bundler`
  - `bundler exec jekyll serve`
- navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:4000>

you'll want to edit [\_config.yml][config.yml] to point to your domain as well.
