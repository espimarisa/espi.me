# [espi.me][espi.me]

My personal website and blog, powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].

## Setup

If you're going to fork my site and host it yourself, use [GitHub Pages][github-pages].

For local development:

- Be sure you have [Ruby][ruby] installed and configured
  - `gem install bundler`
  - `bundler`
  - `bundler exec jekyll serve`
- Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:4000>

You'll want to edit [\_config.yml][config.yml] to point to your domain as well.
