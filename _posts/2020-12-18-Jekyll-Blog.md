## Welcome!

Hey there. If you're reading this, you're probably a pretty decent person. Welcome to my website, and its first blog post. Expect long ramblings and crappy grammar.

## What's Jekyll?

[Jekyll][jekyll] is a really cool static site generator that I've used for various projects before. I decided to go back to using it as I've started to want to blog again, and a self-made system is always miles better than a Ghost instance or some crap like that. I've always had a love-hate relationship with Jekyll, but I've grown to love it for stuff like this.

## Site Goals

My main goals when making a new website was for it to look professional and simple without using a bloated CSS framework or any of that garbage. Additionally, I'm aiming to 100% support screen readers and other accessibility utilities.

I also wanted to have a proper light/dark mode theme, and thanks to the wonders of modern CSS, I was able to do so. I forked the wonderful classless [sakura][sakura] CSS framework and edited it to my liking. I added in automatic light theme styling (dark is the default) for those that prefer a system-wide light theme.

Additionally, I'm hoping to write my thoughts about various things and my experiences with projects down here as [Twitter][twitter] doesn't always work out.

## Closing Thoughts

Overall, I'm pretty proud of this. I think I achieved my goals pretty decently. Theming works nicely and it's light and responsive. (Hopefully) expect more interesting posts in the near future as the main reason for this post existing is to test styling.
