      <p>
        I'm a {age}-year old full-stack software engineer currently located in {location}. I primarily work with TypeScript, Svelte,
        SvelteKit, Astro, and SCSS, but I also know a variety of other frameworks and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I love to get my hands on the latest in enthusiast PC hardware and fine tuning or overclocking it. I enjoy getting my
        hands dirty with new bleeding-edge and innovative software as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy hanging out with my friends (see below), getting to know new people, interacting with my local queer
        community, and being a positive influence to everyone in my presence. Feel free to reach out, I don't bite!
