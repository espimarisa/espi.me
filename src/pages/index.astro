      <p>
        I'm a {age}-year old software developer, tinkerer, and university student based in Birmingham, Alabama.
      </p>

      <p>
        I primarily work with TypeScript and JavaScript, with a preference towards TypeScript. On the frontend side of things, I usually work with Svelte, and I prefer writing custom SCSS instead of using CSS frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>Outside of software development, I enjoy getting my hands on fascinating hardware, usually from the 2000s. I collect and repair laptops, and I enjoy thrifting for niche and obscure electronics.</p>


      <p>Personally speaking, I'm a nonbinary dork interested in anime, e-sports, furry art, local politics, manga, music, and video games. I also collect enamel pins/buttons to put on my iconic hat.</p>
